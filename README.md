# Linear Regression Examples using Python

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to implement linear regression in Python using gradient descent algorithm with different datasets.

## Task 1 - Linear Regression with One Variable

In this task, we have a dataset of a food truck's profits in different cities. The goal is to fit a linear model to the data using gradient descent algorithm with the following requirements:

* Compute the parameters of the model using gradient descent
* Compute and plot the cost function as you perform the gradient descent iterations
* Plot the data with the linear model

The dataset is stored in the file **food_truck_data.txt** which contains two columns: population of a city and the corresponding profit of a food truck in that city. A negative profit indicates a loss. The Jupyter notebook linear_regression_one_variable.ipynb shows the implementation of linear regression with one variable.

## Task 2 - Linear Regression with Multiple Variables

In this task, we have a dataset of house prices with different features. The goal is to fit a linear model to the data using gradient descent algorithm with the following requirements:

* Use feature scaling
* Compute the parameters of the model using gradient descent
* Compute and plot the cost function as you perform the gradient descent iterations </br>

The dataset is stored in the file **housing_price_data.txt** which contains three columns: size of the house in square feet, number of bedrooms, and the corresponding price of the house. The Jupyter notebook linear_regression_multiple_variables.ipynb shows the implementation of linear regression with multiple variables.
